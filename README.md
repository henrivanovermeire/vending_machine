# Vending Machine: A playground for learning new cool stuff

This project serves as a sandbox to experiment with new programming languages in a structured way. 
The goal is always to be able to reproduce the original vending machines behaviour. 

Test-driven development is encouraged; CI/CD setup is underway.
